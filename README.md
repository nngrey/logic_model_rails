#Public Health Logic Model Using Rails

This was an attempt to build a logic model using rails. We did not like where this was going. Instead, we tried to adapt a react kanban app for this purpose. See https://github.com/nngrey/kanban_app

Ultimately, we built a simple logic model app as part of the EMF application at https://github.com/nngrey/emf
